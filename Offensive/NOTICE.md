This project includes multiple components built using approximately 30–40%
AI-generated code snippets, all of which I fully reviewed and understood
before integrating. The AI assistance served only as a development aid;
the design decisions, integrations, and final architecture are entirely
my own.

## Removal of High-Risk Functionality
Certain parts of the original implementation have been **intentionally
removed**. These removed sections included dangerous functionality such as
remote command execution and reverse-shell mechanisms. While I developed
and understood these features for private, legal, and controlled
experiments on machines I own, such code can be easily misused if
published publicly.

To avoid enabling:
- illegal access to systems,
- unauthorized remote control,
- or the creation of malicious tools,

I decided to redact the sensitive portions. Publishing such components
openly may present legal, ethical, and professional risks. Therefore,
only the safe and educational sections remain in this repository.

## Availability for Verified & Lawful Use
For **legitimate, authorized, and professionally validated scenarios**
(e.g., job interviews, security assessments, SOC training, or controlled
laboratory environments), I may provide the full unredacted version **in
private**, after verifying the requestor’s intent and authorization.

## Commitment to Ethical Cybersecurity
This project is released purely for **learning, research, and defensive
security purposes**. I do not support or condone any misuse of the
technology, and I take responsible handling of sensitive code seriously.

Thank you for respecting the boundaries of ethical cybersecurity.
